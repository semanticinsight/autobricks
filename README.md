# Development Setup

Create virual environment and install dependencies for local development:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The application requires the following environment variables specific the databricks workspace and security token that you're using for testing, development and deployment. Substitute your own values between the angled brackets:

```
export DBUTILSTOKEN="<my_token>"
export DATABRICKS_API_HOST="https://<my_databricks_host>.azuredatabricks.net"
```

Exporting variables doesn't make for a great development experience so I recommend using the environment manager tools of your editor and for testing create a ./pytest.ini that looks like this:

```
[pytest]
env =
    DATABRICKS_API_HOST=https://<my_databricks_host>.azuredatabricks.net
    DBUTILSTOKEN=<my_token>
```

**REMINDER: do NOT commit any files that contain security tokens**

Git ignore already contains an exclusion for pytest.ini


# Build

Build python wheel:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
